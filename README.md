# dog_tracker
A full-stack web app for keeping track of dogs. Shows off my understanding of Python, Django and postgres SQL. Full CRUD and connected to a Postgres database. Also includes Django Authentication.

Learning Python and Django is fun! Read more at Django's documentation site. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/

TO DO:
UX needed for back-to-top button
Downsize all dogs images, page is too big and clunky
Background banner for the top and bottom of screen
