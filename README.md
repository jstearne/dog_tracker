# dog_tracker
A full-stack web app for keeping track of dogs. Shows off my understanding of Python, Django and postgres SQL. Full CRUD and connected to a Postgres database. Also includes Django Authentication and Bulma for icons.

Learning Python and Django is fun! Read more at Django's documentation site. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/
